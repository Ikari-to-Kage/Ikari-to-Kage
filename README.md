Sup. If you've found this, you some how managed to fumble into my pile of scratch work. What's here is<br>
mostly just things I've made for class projects, that I actually wanted to share with people. Might be good,<br>
might be crap, probably manually updated as I feel confident in the progress. There is no schedule, time<br>
does not exist, and the chances of catching me half out of my mind and totally out of my element are <br>
extremely high at basically any given time.

All of this said, welcome to the project pile, I accept constructive critism.<br>

And yes, the characters above are my name, in the correct forms. "Rage and Shadow", as a rework of the <br>
original mistranslation I used for many, many years. I'm older, and a bit more prickly than I was-- I thought<br>
it meant 'light and shadow', and then I became an adult...<br>
     And y'all, I thought the adults knew what they were doing as a kid.<br>
          ...I didn't realize it was this bad. (o_o')<br>
